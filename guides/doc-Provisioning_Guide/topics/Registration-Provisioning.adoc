[[Provisioning_through_Registration]]
== Provisioning through Registration

Registration is a provisioning technique, that is used in case you have a machine, that is already installed and you want to add it to the network.

You install the machine by hand (or use any other means) and only after it's installed you register this machine to foreman.


=== Registration workflow

You need to have registration template ready.
You need to have the registration template assigned to an Operating system, you will use for the registered Host.

* You will simply create the host as you would if you would want foreman to provision it.
* You will uncheck the build flag
* You will go to the created host, and on the `Register` tab you will obtain an command looking somewhat like:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# curl <foreman_url>/unattended | bash
----

That's it. This simply downloads an template with bash script, that will run on your system and do the neccessary steps to register (finish the provisioning) in foreman.
