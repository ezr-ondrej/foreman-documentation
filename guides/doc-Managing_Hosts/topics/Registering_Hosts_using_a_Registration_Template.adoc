== Register a Host using a Registration Template

You can register a system that has an operating system installed to {Project} to manage it.

* Ensure that you have a registration template assigned to an operating system that you want to use for the host.

.Procedure

. Create a host as described in xref:creating-a-host-in-satellite[]. While creating a host, click the *Operating System* tab and clear the *Build Mode* check box.
. Navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* and click the host that you created.
. Click the *Register* tab and locate the `curl` command. This command downloads a template and runs it with bash to register the system to {Project}. The command has the following format:
